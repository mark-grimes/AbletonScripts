# Ableton scripts for custom control surfaces

This repository should be cloned into `/Applications/Ableton Live 9 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts` *directly*, i.e. not as a subdirectory as would be the default for git. Note that this directory will have files already in it, don't overwrite those.

A lot of the information for this project was taken from http://julienbayle.net/ableton-live-9-midi-remote-scripts
